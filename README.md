# Supervised_ML_Classifying_MalignantTumors

## Project Description
This project focuses on using supervised machine learning (ML) techniques in the detection of diagnosising malignant tumors using the "" data set. The goal is to identify the best ML algorithm for this classification problem.

## Affilation
This group project was conducted for the Unversity of Notre Dame's Introduction to Data Science course taught by Dr. Roger Woodard, where I was the team leader of two people. 

## Futhermore
The project is currently in progress, where I solely plan to extend the project further by improving the model performance in accounting for all individuals with malignant tumors, performing an imbalanced data analysis, and more.
